Coffee Shop is a simple prototype that lets users browse drinks, customize orders, and place them through a clean, easy-to-use interface.

The project was built using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio** as part of a learning exercise.

> [!NOTE]  
This app was developed during my time as a student, under a tight deadline and while managing other projects.
It offers the core functionality, but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
