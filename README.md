**Coffee Shop** is an application that lets users browse drinks, customize
orders, and place them through a clean, easy-to-use interface.

The project was built using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**.

> [!NOTE]  
This application was developed during my time as a student, under a tight
deadline and while managing other projects. It offers the core functionality,
but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
